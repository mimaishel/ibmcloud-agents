# ☁️ IBM Cloud 🤖 Agents

**Lightweight** Platform Engineering AI agents for IBM Cloud that have built-in access to IBM Cloud MCP tools.

## Features

- **🛠️ MCP-compliant IBM Cloud tools**: Each agent can easily be configured with its own list of IBM Cloud tools that it will use. The integrated [chuk-mcp](https://github.com/chrishayuk/chuk-mcp) library provides multi-server, production quality MCP implementation that is blazing FAST.  
- **Add MCP servers as needed** For agents that require additional tools (MCP servers), you can include them in the Containerfile as a build layer and within the agent configure them alongside the IBM Cloud MCP Server.
- **🪶Lightweight 🕵️ A2A-compliant**: A2A Protocol support is provided via [a2a-server](https://github.com/chrishayuk/a2a-server). Each agent is exposed on A2A endpoints with agent cards that can be easily configured (YAML).
- **📦 Runs on _any_ Container runtime**: Agent containers can be deployed on any container runtime, including Podman, Rancher, Docker™️,  Kubernetes, IBM Cloud Code Engine (serverless), or RedHat™️ OpenShift.
- **🧠 BYOM** - Bring your own model (Caveat: Models MUST support OpenAI-compliant 🛠️tool calling features). The integrated [chuk-llm](https://github.com/chrishayuk/chuk-llm) library makes working with multiple model providers and models extremely SIMPLE--and FAST!
- **☁️ Production Services Integration** - Optional integration with IBM Cloud Monitoring (OTEL metrics), IBM Cloud Logs (centralized logging), and Object Storage (session management) for production deployments. Use the [terraform-ibm-agentic-services](https://github.com/ccmitchellusa/terraform-ibm-agentic-services) deployable architecture for infrastructure-as-code deployment.
- **🕵️ Base Agent** - A base agent example is provided that can be easily customized with different models, tools and instructions to create new IBM Cloud platform engineering agents.

## ❤️ Keeping it simple

The common core of the agents is found in [`src/ibmcloud_base_agent/agent.py`](src/ibmcloud_base_agent/agent.py), which is a template for building other agents and has:

- 🧠Model connection - OpenAI, Anthropic, LiteLLM, etc.
- 🛠️IBMCloud MCP Server tool configuration for basic IBM Cloud commands to set target context and listing resource groups.
- 🕵️Agent 📃instructions - System prompt that defines the agents core behavior

The **Supervisor Agent** is now the default agent that will appear when connecting to the server with a2a-cli (or other a2a client app), providing intelligent task delegation to specialized agents.

## 📚 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory:

- **[📖 Getting Started](docs/README.md)** - Complete overview and quick start guide
- **[🤖 Agent Overview](docs/agents/README.md)** - Understanding all available agents  
- **[🎩 Kingsmen Curl Tutorial](docs/tutorials/KINGSMEN_CURL_TUTORIAL.md)** - Complete guide to using curl commands
- **[🛠️ Interactive Examples](docs/examples/kingsmen_curl_examples.sh)** - Hands-on demo script

### Quick Tutorial Access

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
# Start the server with all agents
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export IBMCLOUD_API_KEY="your-ibm-key"
./run.sh

# Connect with the default Supervisor Agent
uvx a2a-cli --server http://localhost:8000 chat

# Or try the Kingsmen team with curl commands:
./docs/examples/kingsmen_curl_examples.sh
```

## 🗜️Installation & Setup

1. Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
2. Install [IBM Cloud MCP Server](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/mcp)
3. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccmitchellusa/ibmcloud-agents.git
cd ibmcloud-agents
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --reinstall
```

## Configure Keys

To run the example, you will need api keys for:
1. OpenAI or other LLM provider (Anthropic, Gemini, Watsonx, etc.) - The demos are preconfigured for OpenAI models (gpt-4o-mini). See [chuk-llm]([https://github.com/chrishayuk/chuk-llm](https://github.com/chrishayuk/chuk-llm?tab=readme-ov-file#provider-specific-dependencies)) for other supported model providers.  The chosen model MUST support Tool calls (OpenAI format) to work with these agents and MCP.
2. IBM Cloud - For a quick start demo, you should create a an account to use for testing purposes.  The agents will all be sharing your user API key which will need broad access to many areas.  NOTE: This is NOT recommended for production environements, in production, you will want to setup service id's and access groups to have tight control over what your agents can do within your account (least priviledge)!

Next, create a `.env` file with the above keys in the root of the ibmcloud-agents folder:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_goes_here
IBMCLOUD_API_KEY=your_IBMCloud_api_key
```

## 🏃🏼Run the Agent Server (Local host)

Start the agent server locally (from the root folder of ibmcloud-agents):

```bash
./run.sh
```

Open browser on `http://localhost:8000/agent-card.json` to view card JSON. This verifies that the agents are running.

## Install an A2A Client

To connect to the agents over A2A protocol, you will need an A2A client.  The simplest A2A client which runs from the command line is  Chris Hay's [A2A CLI](https://github.com/chrishayuk/a2a-cli).  
In a separate shell, issue the following command to install and run the a2a-cli and connect it to the running agents.

```bash
uvx a2a-cli --server http://localhost:8000 chat
```

# Understanding the Agent Architecture

## 🎯 Intelligent Agent Coordination

The system now features **two levels of coordination**:

### 1. **Supervisor Agent** (Default) 🤖
The **Supervisor Agent** serves as the default entry point and provides intelligent task delegation using LLM-powered routing. It analyzes your requests and automatically delegates to the most appropriate specialized agent.

**Available via**: `http://localhost:8000` (default) or `http://localhost:8000/supervisor_agent`

### 2. **The Kingsmen** 🎩 (Elite Team)
An alternative coordination approach featuring a themed team of IBM Cloud specialists, each with codenames and specialized expertise:

| Codename | Agent | Expertise |

## ☁️ IBM Cloud Services Integration

### Optional Supporting Services

When deploying to IBM Cloud Code Engine, you can optionally set up supporting services for production monitoring and session management:

- **📊 IBM Cloud Monitoring (Sysdig)** - OTEL metrics collection and application monitoring
- **📝 IBM Cloud Logs** - Centralized logging and log analysis  
- **🗂️ Object Storage** - Persistent session management and conversation history

### Setting up Supporting Services

1. **Create the services**:
   ```bash
   # Set up required environment variables
   cp .env.ibmcloud.example .env.ibmcloud
   # Edit .env.ibmcloud with your IBM Cloud settings
   
   # Create all supporting services
   make ibmcloud-services-setup
   ```

2. **Get service credentials**:
   ```bash
   # Display environment variables for the created services
   make ibmcloud-services-env
   ```

3. **Configure your deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the output from step 2 to your .env.ibmcloud file
   # Set the *_ENABLED flags to true for services you want to use
   
   # Example:
   IBMCLOUD_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
   IBMCLOUD_LOGS_ENABLED=true  
   IBMCLOUD_COS_ENABLED=true
   ```

4. **Deploy with services**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy to IBM Cloud with monitoring and storage
   make ibmcloud-all
   ```

### Service Configuration Details

The agents automatically detect and configure these services based on environment variables:

- **Monitoring**: OTEL metrics are automatically exported to IBM Cloud Monitoring when enabled
- **Logging**: Application logs are sent to IBM Cloud Logs for centralized analysis
- **Storage**: Session data and conversation history are stored in Object Storage for persistence

For manual configuration, see the service configuration in [`agent.yaml`](agent.yaml) and [`src/common/services.py`](src/common/services.py).

### Connecting to remote agents running on IBM Cloud Code Engine

Connect [a2a-cli](https://github.com/chrishayuk/a2a-cli) to an agent running on Code Engine:

1. In the IBM Cloud console> Code Engine > Application page, click "Test Application" in upper right corner.  Copy the app's url.
2. Replace the url in the following snippet with the actual app's url from Step 1:

```bash
uvx a2a-cli --server https://ibmcloud-agents.1uo9xqkaspg3.us-east.codeengine.appdomain.cloud chat
# add --log-level DEBUG for detailed output
```
