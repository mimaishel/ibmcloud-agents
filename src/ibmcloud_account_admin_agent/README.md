# IBM Cloud Account Admin Agent

Next switch to the **Account Admin agent**:

```bash
/connect http://localhost:8000/ibmcloud_account_admin_agent
```

![Account Admin's Agent Card](../../docs/images/account_admin_agent_card.png)

and ask

```text
What can you help me with?
```

You will see various management tasks for working with IBM Cloud accounts, users and IAM access policies and groups for users and services.  Try listing the users in your account (your agent will need an API Key with Admin access for this, and most of the capabilities of this agent).
